# Two-Level-Adaptive-Branch-Prediction
This project implements a branch predictor simulation using two prediction models: Global Predictor (GAp) and Per-Address Predictor (PAp). The implementation focuses on accurately predicting branch outcomes while evaluating the trade-offs between prediction accuracy and hardware cost.
